# Route-Optimization-of-RapidKL-Bus-using-ACO-Algorithm
RapidKL bus routes currently face inefficiencies leading to longer travel times. To address this, RapidKL is exploring Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) â€“ an algorithm inspired by ant foraging behavior. ACO will be used to identify the most efficient routes for each bus, minimizing travel times. This involves finding the optimal sequence of bus stops, considering factors like distance (calculated using latitude and longitude) and potential variations in travel speed.
