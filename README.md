# Route-Optimization-of-RapidKL-Bus-using-ACO-Algorithm
RapidKL bus routes currently face inefficiencies leading to longer travel times. To address this, RapidKL is exploring Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) â€“ an algorithm inspired by ant foraging behavior. ACO will be used to identify the most efficient routes for each bus, minimizing travel times.
